# TRIARCH: SHATTERED REALMS – Theory and Gameplay Overview

## One-Page Developer Pitch

**Concept Summary**: Triarch: Shattered Realms is a mobile-first MMORPG that blends the best aspects of classic MMOs with modern design. It draws on World of Warcraft's clear class identities and accessible combat, Old School RuneScape's risk-versus-reward and player-driven economy, and a compact world design inspired by modern indie MMOs. The result is a fast-paced, session-friendly MMO where player decisions have weight and progression is meaningful but not endless.

## Core Design Pillars

### 1. Clear, Compact Combat

Players engage in real-time combat with a limited, readable skill set (4–6 active abilities + 1 ultimate). Every ability has a distinct purpose and visual cue, avoiding "ability bloat." This ensures fights are easy to follow on mobile and skill-based.

**Key Features:**
- Combat is short (encounters ~30–90 seconds) but tactical
- Positioning, timed interrupts, and combos matter
- Clear spell animations and telegraphed moves for counterplay
- Each class's abilities are visually distinct and recognizable

**Design Philosophy**: In WoW Classic, each class's abilities were so distinct that you could tell a Warrior from a Mage just by watching the fight. Triarch leverages this philosophy, using clear spell animations and telegraphed moves so players can react and counter.

### 2. Finite Progression, Horizontal Endgame

Leveling stops at **Level 60** – there is no infinite gear treadmill or constant level-cap raise.

**Progression System:**
- Each level grants a few points for core stats (Power, Control, Resilience)
- Ability upgrades (e.g., minor cooldown reductions or added effects)
- Passive traits (crit chance, lifesteal, etc.)
- By max level, players commit to a build, creating a capped power level

**Beyond Level 60:**
- Progress is horizontal – driven by player skill, reputation, and gear choices
- No endless power creep keeps PvP fair for veterans and newcomers alike
- Respects players' time – no endless grind

**Design Philosophy**: Similar to FFXI, which kept a level cap (75) for years to encourage alternative progression. The goal is to respect players' time and ensure player skill and decision-making trump hours played, which is more inviting for a mobile, on-the-go audience.

### 3. High-Stakes Zones & Consequences

The game world is divided into risk-based zones to cater to different playstyles:

#### Safe Zones
- PvE-focused (no PvP, no loot drop)
- Ideal for story quests, crafting, and casual play
- Common materials and resources

#### Contested Zones
- Enable open PvP with partial loot drop
- Defeated players lose a few items or resources
- Mid-tier resources and rewards

#### High-Risk Zones
- Full-loot PvP areas
- If you die, everything you're carrying can be looted
- Richest rewards (rare resources, relics, bosses)
- Exotic materials for top-tier crafting

**Risk-Reward Principle**: The more you risk, the more you can gain. Similar to Albion Online's red/black zones, players can stick to safer content or brave deadly zones for top-tier rewards. Death matters – even in mid-level contested areas, losing a fight might cost some gear, making PvP encounters tense and meaningful.

**Casual Player Protection**: Players aren't forced into high-risk gameplay; they can enjoy progression in safer zones and only risk what they're willing to lose.

### 4. Three-Faction Warfare (Beyond "Red vs Blue")

The world's power struggle involves three distinct factions instead of the usual two.

#### The Iron Covenant (Order/Industry)
- Values heavy armor and siege warfare
- Philosophy: Discipline, defense, and industrial might
- Strengths: Defensive capabilities, fortifications

#### The Verdant Reach (Nature/Magic)
- Emphasizes mobility and PvE advantages
- Philosophy: Harmony with nature, magical prowess
- Strengths: Agility, environmental advantages

#### The Abyssal Remnant (Chaos/Void)
- Thrives on risky power and self-damaging magic
- Philosophy: Power through sacrifice, void manipulation
- Strengths: High-risk, high-reward abilities

**Strategic Complexity:**
- Battles aren't always one-sided; a third faction can opportunistically intervene
- Three-way wars prevent stalemates and curb dominant-faction snowballing
- If one faction grows too strong, the other two can form a temporary alliance
- Each faction offers distinct playstyles and economic perks
- Asymmetry keeps PvP endgame fresh as tactics must adapt

**Design Philosophy**: Inspired by Dark Age of Camelot's acclaimed Realm-vs-Realm PvP, where three-faction warfare prevented monotony and single-faction dominance.

### 5. Meaningful Faction Betrayal

Faction choice is meaningful – you cannot simply flip sides with a menu option.

**Betrayal Process:**
- Undertake a lengthy betrayal questline
- Lose all current faction reputation
- Temporarily forfeit faction-specific gear/bonuses
- Suffer a period of "exile" debuffs:
  - NPCs distrust you
  - Limited city access
  - Temporary penalties

**Design Philosophy**: Similar to EverQuest II's multi-step quest and temporary exile system. Betrayal should feel like a story – perhaps uncovering corruption in your faction – rather than a trivial choice. It's allowed, but it's rare and costly (both narratively and in gameplay).

This design:
- Preserves faction identity and rivalry
- Gives dedicated players a chance to experience another faction's content
- Makes faction changes immersive and meaningful

### 6. Player-Driven Economy & Life Skills

All players can train gathering and crafting skills, providing parallel progression paths.

**Life Skills:**
- Mining
- Woodcutting
- Fishing
- Crafting (blacksmithing, etc.)
- Alchemy
- Runecrafting

**Economic System:**
- Skills have their own levels and uses (potentially uncapped or soft-capped)
- Most of the best gear is crafted by players
- Resources from high-risk zones are especially valuable
- Interdependent economy:
  - Adventurers need crafters for weapons
  - Crafters need adventurers for rare materials from dangerous regions

**Resource Distribution:**
- Common materials in Safe zones
- Exotic materials in full-loot zones
- Creates natural risk-reward for gathering

**Design Philosophy**: Similar to EVE Online and RuneScape, this creates a robust social ecosystem. Resources from PvP zones become valuable trade goods, fueling conflict and cooperation between factions. Even at max combat level, players have reasons to gather, craft, trade, and specialize in professions.

### 7. Endgame Focus – Territory, Reputation, Skill

With no higher levels beyond 60, the endgame centers on player skill and social competition.

**Territory Control:**
- Factions (or guilds) vie for control of outposts in contested/high-risk zones
- Controlling territory confers economic bonuses or resource access
- Real stakes: controlling a mine gives your faction abundant ore

**Faction Wars & PvP Seasons:**
- Success yields reputation and cosmetic rewards
- Prestige over raw power

**Reputation Ladders:**
- Measure standing within faction
- Earned through:
  - PvP contributions
  - PvE feats
  - Crafting contributions
- Top contributors earn titles, special mounts, or vanity outfits

**Horizontal Progression:**
- Collecting and mastering different gear sets or builds
- Build respecialization has a cost, so choices matter
- Many players create alts or invest in multiple builds
- All builds remain within a tight power range for balance

**High-Risk Expeditions:**
- Raids into chaotic zones
- World bosses in lawless areas
- Coordination and risk management are key

**Session-Friendly Design:**
- Quick battleground
- Gathering run in a risky zone
- Dungeon run
- All provide meaningful progress

**Design Philosophy**: Endgame activities reward skill, strategy, and risk-taking rather than sheer time invested. By avoiding infinite grind, Triarch ensures player skill and decision-making trump hours played.

## Why It Will Succeed

Triarch: Shattered Realms offers a fresh balance between accessibility and depth:

1. **Mobile-Friendly Combat**: Short, engaging fights with minimal UI clutter fit modern life and devices without sacrificing the MMO feel
2. **Finite Progression**: New players can catch up and PvP remains skill-based, addressing a common MMO problem of veteran power gaps
3. **High-Stakes PvP**: Creates adrenaline-fueled emergent gameplay and a vibrant economy (players care about conflicts when gear is on the line!)
4. **Flexible Playstyles**: Those who prefer safer progress or PvE have their space in the world too
5. **Three-Faction Dynamic**: Guarantees a constantly shifting balance of power, fostering player-driven stories of alliance and betrayal
6. **Respects Player Time**: Play a quick session and still make progress, choose your risks, build your unique class spec, and shape the world through your faction

**Design Principle**: "Elegant over complex, limited to what a touchscreen can manage" – the game is deep but not overwhelming on a phone or controller.

## Full Class Design Example: The Bulwark (Iron Covenant Tank)

To illustrate how classes work end-to-end in Triarch, below is a full design for one class: the Bulwark, a shield-bearing tank from the Iron Covenant faction.

### Class Concept and Role

**Faction**: Iron Covenant (Order/Industry) – the Bulwark embodies the Covenant's ideals of defense and battlefield control. In lore, Bulwarks are elite vanguards armed with tower shields and sworn to protect allies and hold the line.

**Role**: Frontline Tank/Control
- Primary job: Absorb damage, disrupt enemies, and create space for allies
- Excel in defensive synergies (buffing allies' defenses) and area denial

**Playstyle**: 
- Methodical advancement with shield raised
- Timing cooldowns to negate big enemy attacks and retaliate
- **PvE**: Hold boss aggro and use stuns/taunts to manage mobs
- **PvP**: Use crowd-control and body-blocking to protect teammates or lock down key foes
- Moderate damage output, but presence can turn the tide
- Positioning and timing are crucial

### Ability Kit (Active Skills & Ultimate)

At max level, a Bulwark has five active abilities plus one Ultimate:

#### 1. Shield Slam
**Type**: Melee stun, 15s cooldown

Bash the target with shield, dealing modest damage and stunning for 2 seconds. If the target was casting, interrupts the spell.

**Enhancements**:
- +Damage
- Longer stun on extended cooldown

**Usage**: Bread-and-butter opener to disrupt dangerous foes.

#### 2. Defensive Stance
**Type**: Self-buff, 20s cooldown

Brace for impact, reducing all damage taken by 30% for 6 seconds. Movement is slowed slightly during this stance.

**Enhancements**:
- Reflect 10% of damage back to attackers
- Grant nearby allies 15% damage reduction for the duration

**Usage**: Reactive survival tool – time it to survive big enemy hits or focus fire.

#### 3. Shield Wall
**Type**: Group defensive cooldown, 60s cooldown

Raise a barrier that absorbs damage for all allies in a small radius behind you. For 4 seconds, the Bulwark and any allies immediately behind the shield have 50% of incoming damage absorbed by the Bulwark's health (redirected).

**Mechanics**:
- Encourages formations – allies must position behind the tank
- Excellent for blocking cone attacks or volleys
- After effect ends, "Shattered Armor" debuff prevents chaining

**Usage**: Critical defensive moment for the entire team.

#### 4. Taunting Shout
**Type**: AoE taunt/mark, 25s cooldown

Bellow a challenge, forcing nearby PvE enemies to switch aggro to the Bulwark for 5 seconds.

**PvP Effect**: Marks up to 3 enemy players with "Challenged" debuff – if they attack anyone else but the Bulwark in the next 5 seconds, their damage is reduced by 20%.

**Enhancements**:
- Increase debuff penalty
- Increase radius

**Usage**: Tactical tool to protect healers or squishy allies.

#### 5. Charging Assault
**Type**: Gap-closer + knockback, 30s cooldown

Rush forward 15 meters with shield first. If you collide with an enemy, knock them back and briefly daze them (1s stun). Any allies in your path get a small speed boost.

**Enhancements**:
- Shorter cooldown but no daze
- Longer knockback distance

**Usage**: Engage fights or peel enemies off allies. Requires careful aim.

#### 6. Ultimate – Aegis of the Covenant
**Type**: Ultimate, 90s cooldown (charges via combat actions)

Call upon the Iron Covenant's power to become a living bulwark for 8 seconds:
- Damage taken is halved
- Every hit blocked (via shield or parry) heals nearby allies for a small amount
- Crowd-control immunity for first 3 seconds
- Visually surrounded by golden aura with Iron Covenant insignia

**Aftermath**: "Exhausted" debuff (lower move speed or minor defense penalty) for a few seconds to prevent chaining.

**Enhancements**: Legendary relics might slightly increase heal radius or extend duration by 1s, but base power stays fixed for balance.

**Usage**: Anchor critical moments – standing ground on a flag while allies rally, or surviving a boss's enraged phase.

### Ability Design Philosophy

Each skill has clear counter-play:
- Enemies can switch targets during Defensive Stance or kite until it expires
- Shield Wall can be countered by flanking or crowd-controlling the Bulwark
- The Bulwark must decide the right moments – using Ultimate too early could mean it's on cooldown when truly needed

With only five actives, the Bulwark doesn't have dozens of skills, but these cover:
- Defense
- Control
- Mobility
- Utility

Short cooldowns (most 15–30s) fit mobile session design and ensure the Bulwark always has something useful to do each fight.

### Passive Traits and Stat Specialization

By level 60, the Bulwark has allocated points into core stats and chosen passive traits.

#### Core Stats Example

For a typical Bulwark with 60 stat points (1 per level):
- **30 into Resilience**: High health and armor
- **20 into Control**: Stronger crowd-control effects
- **10 into Power**: Lower damage output

**Trade-offs**: Another Bulwark might choose more Power for solo play, but can't have both max survivability and max damage due to the cap. Stat allocation is locked unless the player respecs (which has a cost).

This ensures even the tankiest Bulwark can still be out-damaged by DPS classes, maintaining class roles.

#### Passive Traits

Throughout leveling, the Bulwark can pick passive perks:

**Shield Specialist**
- +5% chance to block attacks
- Successful blocks grant small damage bonus on next Shield Slam

**Iron Fortress**
- Increases Defensive Stance duration by 2 seconds
- OR increases Shield Wall absorption by 10%

**Retribution**
- Every block or parry deals small holy damage to attackers
- Helps Bulwark contribute more damage and punishes focus fire

**Inspire Allies**
- Allies near the Bulwark gain minor armor bonus (+5%)
- Fits theme of protective leader

**Last Stand**
- Once per few minutes, if health drops below 20%, instantly recover 15% health
- Clutch survival passive with internal cooldown

A max-level Bulwark might fully specialize in 2 of these and take lesser bonuses in others:
- Pure defensive wall: Max Shield Specialist and Iron Fortress
- Buffing/offensive tank: Invest in Retribution and Inspire Allies

These passives allow fine-tuning but don't create wild power disparities – they offer sidegrades. Since Triarch stops vertical growth at 60, expansions would introduce new trait options or gear rather than higher level/stat ceilings.

### Progression and Build Lock-in

**Class Selection**: Chosen at character creation as an Iron Covenant player, providing a defined ability pool and playstyle.

**Leveling 1-60**: Periodically unlock new abilities and gain stat/trait points.

**Build Lock-in**: Upon reaching 60, have a complete build (stat distribution + chosen trait specializations). Can be changed by respecializing at a faction trainer or shrine for significant resource/currency cost.

**Trade-offs**:
- Pure defense build: Incredible survivability but low damage (great for groups, less for solo)
- Balanced build: Can respec for solo play but not on a whim
- Maintains weight of choices and importance of reputation

**Gear and Loot**:
- Heavy plate armor and shields, plus one-handed weapons
- Gear provides additional stats (within capped framework) and special bonuses
- High-tier gear might increase block chance or grant ability bonuses (e.g., reduced Shield Wall cooldown)

**Risk Dynamic**: Full-loot in high-risk zones means balancing best gear (for power) vs. risk of losing it. Often carry spare set of cheaper armor for PvP excursions.

**Crafting Needs**: Top-tier shields might need rare ore from dangerous mines (encouraging cooperation or bravery).

**Faction Warfare Value**: Highly valued for holding choke points and anchoring raids. Well-equipped Bulwarks boost group morale and become priority targets.

### Playstyle in Action

#### PvE (Dungeon Boss)

Party enters an ancient vault in a contested zone. The Bulwark:
1. Pulls groups of undead with Taunting Shout
2. When Lich boss casts massive fireball, times Shield Wall to cover DPS
3. During boss's frenzy phase, pops Aegis of the Covenant ultimate
4. Stands strong while healer struggles to keep everyone alive

**Skill Matters**: Misusing a cooldown (Shield Wall too early) can put the group in peril if another big attack comes. Skillful play is rewarded.

#### PvP (Faction Skirmish)

5v5 outpost battle:
1. Leads Iron Covenant charge with Charging Assault, knocking enemy assassin away
2. Follows with Shield Slam on enemy Inquisitor (high-DPS), stunning to prevent burst
3. Uses Taunting Shout to discourage enemies from focusing the healer
4. When Verdant Reach summons nature vines (AOE), raises Shield Wall to protect allies
5. Control stat boosts knockback on Charging Assault, allowing chase and punt fleeing enemy

**Counterplay**: Enemies can bait Shield Slam, then stun Bulwark when they wanted to Shield Wall. Smart enemies find ways around defenses. Player skill and teamwork decide outcome, not just stats.

### How the Bulwark Exemplifies Triarch's Design

The Bulwark showcases core philosophies:

1. **Clear, readable abilities**: Opponents can recognize Defensive Stance or Aegis ultimate visually and respond accordingly
2. **Capped power**: Formidable at level 60 but not invincible or endlessly scaling. Relies on strategy, gear, teamwork
3. **Fair competition**: New level 60 can tank as effectively as veteran level 60 if they understand the class
4. **Risk-reward**: In high-risk zones, might wear lower-tier gear to avoid huge loss, balancing power vs. economics
5. **Faction identity**: Abilities like Aegis of the Covenant tie to Iron Covenant's discipline and defense. If betraying to another faction, visual/mechanical tweaks preserve gameplay while showing allegiance change

**Conclusion**: The Bulwark demonstrates how Triarch's mechanics create compelling experience. A class with focused role and high skill ceiling, benefitting from no-power-creep philosophy. Whether holding the line in PvE raid or leading charge in PvP war, success hinges on smart use of finite tools and working with allies – exactly the engaging, skill-based gameplay Triarch: Shattered Realms delivers.
