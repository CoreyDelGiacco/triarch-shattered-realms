    "description": "A shield-bearing tank from the Iron Covenant faction. Bulwarks are elite vanguards armed with tower shields and sworn to protect allies and hold the line. They might be the ironclad knights defending Covenant strongholds.",
    "playstyle": "Bulwarks play methodically, advancing with shield raised and timing cooldowns to negate big enemy attacks and retaliate. In PvE, they hold boss aggro and use stuns/taunts to manage mobs. In PvP, they use crowd-control and body-blocking to protect teammates or lock down key foes. Their damage is moderate, but their presence can turn the tide by making their team much harder to kill."
